### Added

#### Multiple Profiles Support üéØ
- **Profile Management**: Create and manage multiple EQ profiles (e.g., "Headphones", "Speakers", "Car")
- **Profile Switching**: Instantly switch between profiles with automatic preset reapplication
- **Profile Persistence**: Active profile saved and restored across app restarts
- **Per-Profile Mappings**: Each profile maintains separate song/album/genre ‚Üí preset mappings
- **Profile UI**: Dropdown selector with create, rename, and delete dialogs
- **Built-in Profiles**: Default profile created automatically, cannot be deleted

#### Audio Improvements
- **Format Auto-Fallback**: LocalDacSink now automatically falls back between F32 ‚Üî S16LE formats
- **Device Detection**: Check supported audio formats before opening stream to prevent failures
- **Setup Script Options**: `--with-loopback` flag for optional audio loopback creation
- **Improved Documentation**: Step-by-step AAEQ usage instructions in setup script

#### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Logo Display**: Added AAEQ logo to README header for better branding
- **XFCE Tray Fix**: Added helpful diagnostics and instructions for XFCE users
- **Error Messages**: Smart detection of desktop environment with actionable guidance

### Fixed

#### Critical Bug Fixes üêõ
- **Device Persistence**: Input/Output device selections now persist correctly across restarts
  - Fixed `INSERT OR REPLACE` SQL pattern that was clearing other columns
  - Changed to `UPDATE` pattern to preserve all settings independently
  - Applies to: last_connected_host, last_input_device, last_output_device, active_profile_id

- **Genre Persistence**: Manual genre edits now persist correctly
  - Genre overrides now loaded on every poll, not just on track change
  - Fixed in both WiiM and MPRIS (DSP) polling paths
  - Manual genre changes no longer revert to "Unknown"

#### Audio Device Compatibility
- Automatic format fallback prevents device initialization failures
- Better handling of devices with limited format support
- Improved error messages for audio device issues

### Changed

#### Database Schema
- Added `profile` table for storing user profiles
- Added `profile_id` column to `mapping` table (foreign key)
- Added `active_profile_id` to `app_settings` table
- Updated `mapping` unique constraint to include `profile_id`
- Migration: `007_profiles.sql`

#### Setup Script
- Default behavior: only creates virtual sink (no loopback)
- Loopback now optional with `--with-loopback` flag
- Clearer instructions for AAEQ integration
- Warning about double audio when using both loopback and AAEQ

#### Documentation
- Added comprehensive Multiple Profiles section to README
- Updated Known Limitations with detailed XFCE tray icon solution
- Added profile database tables to schema documentation
- Improved audio capture setup instructions

### Technical Details

#### Architecture Changes
- Profile-scoped rule resolution in async worker
- Profile switching triggers full rules index reload
- `ReapplyPresetForCurrentTrack` command for profile changes
- Profile repository with full CRUD operations

#### Performance
- Efficient profile switching with targeted database queries
- Rules index cached per profile for fast lookups
- Minimal overhead for profile management
